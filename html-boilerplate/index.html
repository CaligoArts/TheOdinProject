            <strong>Main thing's to know about HTML is:</strong>
            <!--Creates Unordered list, meaning it uses bullet points-->
            <ul>
                <!--Creates each bullet point in list-->
                <li>You use Tags & Elements.</li>   
                <li>Tags are brackets "<>" that contain an Element.</li>
                <li>The Element is the instruction, telling the browser how to display the content.</li>
                <li>Most all tags have an opening tag & closing tag.</li>
                <li>Void tags are the exception like meta & img because it has no closing tag.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <!--Creates ordered list. Meaning it's numbered-->
        <ol>    
            <li>List item 1.</li>
            <li>List item 2.</li>
            <li>List item 3.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <!--Makes Bold and labels important for screen readers to change to communicate importance-->
            <strong>Bold</strong>
        </p>
        <!--Emphasizes text by making it Italic. Put inside a <p> element to seperate from <strong> as these don't separate sections.-->
        <p><em>Italic</em></p>
        <p>
            <!--Absolute Links:-->

            <!--noreferrer value prevents opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link or reference to it. *also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well.-->
